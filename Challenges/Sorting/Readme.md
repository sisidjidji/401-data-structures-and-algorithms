Sample Arrays
In your blog article, visually show the output of processing this input array:

[8,4,23,42,16,15]

For your own understanding, consider also stepping through these inputs:

Reverse-sorted: [20,18,12,8,5,-2]
Few uniques: [5,12,7,5,5,7]
Nearly-sorted: [2,3,5,7,13,11]
Implementation
Provide a visual step through for each of the sample arrays based on the provided pseudo code
Convert the pseudo-code into working code in your language
Present a complete set of working tests
